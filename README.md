# Darkgos: Community Dorks Repository
Welcome to the Darkgos Community Dorks Repository! This repository is dedicated to sharing high-quality dorks that produce low or no false positive results. [Darkgos](https://www.darkgos.xyz) is a web search application designed to assist in cybersecurity efforts by identifying potential security risks associated with domain configurations. The application leverages dorks to uncover instances of misconfigurations, default settings, or other vulnerabilities that may expose sensitive information or secrets.

## What are Dorks?
Dorks are specialized search queries used to identify specific information or vulnerabilities on the internet. In the context of Darkgos, dorks are employed to uncover instances of misconfigurations, default settings, or other vulnerabilities that may expose sensitive information or secrets associated with a domain.
